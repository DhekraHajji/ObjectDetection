Import necessary libraries: The code imports the cv2 (OpenCV) and numpy libraries. OpenCV provides computer vision functionality, and Numpy is used for numerical operations in Python.

Load YOLO model: The YOLO (You Only Look Once) model is a popular deep learning-based object detection algorithm. The cv2.dnn.readNet function is used to load the YOLO model weights and configuration files. The weights file (yolov3.weights) contains the learned parameters of the model, and the configuration file (yolov3.cfg) specifies the network architecture.

Load class names: The code reads the class names from the file coco.names. Each line in the file represents a different class label. The class names are stored in a list called classes.

Open video capture: The code opens a video file for reading using the cv2.VideoCapture function. The file path of the video is specified as "C:\\Users\\Dhekra Hajji\\OneDrive - CXG\\Bureau\\video.mp4". This will allow the code to read frames from the video.

Get video frame dimensions: The code retrieves the width and height of the video frames using the cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH and cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT properties of the video capture object (cap). These values represent the dimensions of each frame in pixels and are stored in the variables frame_width and frame_height, respectively.

Define the desired display dimensions: The code sets the desired width and height for displaying the frames. The variables display_width and display_height are defined as 800 and 600, respectively. These values determine the size at which the frames will be displayed.

Calculate scaling factors for resizing: The code calculates the scaling factors (scale_width and scale_height) that will be used to resize the frames to the desired display dimensions. These scaling factors are computed by dividing the display dimensions by the frame dimensions. They represent the ratio by which the frames need to be scaled up or down.

Define output video writer: The code creates a video writer object using the cv2.VideoWriter function. It specifies the output file name as "output.mp4", the four-character code cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v") for the video codec, the frame rate of 30 frames per second (30.0), and the frame size ((frame_width, frame_height)).

The code sets up the YOLO model, loads class names, opens the video capture, retrieves frame dimensions, defines display dimensions, and initializes the output video writer. These steps are necessary for subsequent processing and object detection tasks.

 The code inside the while loop reads each frame from the video capture, resizes it, performs object detection using the YOLO model, and draws bounding boxes and labels around the detected objects.




Read frame from video capture: The code uses the cap.read() function to read the next frame from the video capture object (cap). The return value ret indicates whether the frame was successfully read, and the frame itself is stored in the variable frame.

Check if frame was successfully read: The code checks if ret is False, indicating that there are no more frames to read from the video. If this condition is true, the code breaks out of the while loop using the break statement.

Resize the frame: The code resizes the frame to the desired display size using the cv2.resize() function. It takes the frame and the dimensions (display_width, display_height) as input and returns the resized frame, which is then stored back in the frame variable.

Get the frame dimensions: The code extracts the height and width of the resized frame using the shape attribute of the frame. The dimensions are unpacked into the variables height and width.

Create a blob from the frame: The code converts the resized frame into a blob using the cv2.dnn.blobFromImage() function. It takes the frame, scaling factor of 1/255.0 to normalize the pixel values, target size of (416, 416), swapRB=True to swap the Red and Blue channels, and crop=False to resize the frame while maintaining its aspect ratio. The resulting blob is stored in the variable blob.
Create a blob from the frame: The cv2.dnn.blobFromImage function prepares the frame for input to the neural network. It resizes the frame to a specific size (416x416 pixels), normalizes the pixel values to the range [0, 1], and converts the frame to a blob format that the network can process. The resulting blob is stored in the blob variable.

Set the input blob for the network: The code sets the input blob for the neural network using the net.setInput() function. It takes the blob as input and prepares the network for performing a forward pass.

Perform forward pass: The code performs a forward pass through the network using the net.forward() function. It takes the names of the unconnected output layers as input, obtained using net.getUnconnectedOutLayersNames(), and returns the output blobs outs.

Initialize lists for storing detections: The code initializes empty lists boxes, confidences, and class_ids to store the bounding boxes, confidences, and class IDs of the detected objects, respectively.

Process the output detections: The code iterates over each output blob out from outs and each detection within the blob. It retrieves the confidence scores, determines the class ID with the highest score using np.argmax(), and calculates the corresponding confidence value. If the confidence is greater than 0.5, the code proceeds to process the detection.

Scale the bounding box coordinates: The code scales the bounding box coordinates from the resized frame back to the original frame dimensions. It calculates the center coordinates, width, and height of the bounding box based on the relative values provided in the detection. It then computes the top-left corner coordinates of the bounding box.

Store the bounding box, confidence, and class ID: The code appends the bounding box [x, y, bbox_width, bbox_height], confidence value float(confidence), and class ID class_id to their respective lists boxes, confidences, and class_ids.

Apply non-maximum suppression: The code applies non-maximum suppression using the cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes() function. It takes the boxes, confidences, a threshold value of 0.5 for the intersection over union (IoU) overlap, and a second threshold value of 0.4 for the confidence score. The function returns the indices of the boxes that passed the suppression.

Draw bounding boxes and labels: The code generates random colors for each class and iterates over the indices of the remaining boxes after non-maximum suppression. It retrieves the coordinates, label, color, and confidence for each box and uses the cv2.rectangle() and cv2.putText() functions to draw the bounding box and label on the frame, respectively.

Write the processed frame to the output video: The code writes the processed frame to the output video using the output.write() function. It takes the frame as input and adds it to the video file.

Display the resulting frame: The code uses the cv2.imshow() function to display the resulting frame in a window titled "Object Detection". This allows real-time visualization of the object detection process.

Check for 'q' key press to exit: The code checks if the 'q' key has been pressed by calling cv2.waitKey(1) and comparing the returned value to the ASCII code of 'q' (ord("q")). If the 'q' key is pressed, the code breaks out of the while loop and ends the program.

Release the video capture and output video writer: After the while loop ends, the code releases the resources associated with the video capture object (cap.release()) and the output video writer (output.release()). This is important for freeing up system resources and closing the video files.

Close all OpenCV windows: Finally, the code calls cv2.destroyAllWindows() to close any open windows created by OpenCV during the execution of the program.

This code performs object detection on each frame of a video, draws bounding boxes and labels around the detected objects, and saves the processed frames into an output video file.
